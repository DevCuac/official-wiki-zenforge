# What is Zenforge Studio

**Zenforge Studio** is a passionate team of developers, builders, designers, and creatives dedicated to forging high-quality products for the Minecraft and web development community. We were born from the belief that the tools we provide should not only be powerful, but also elegant, intuitive, and optimized.

## Our Services

### ‚öôÔ∏è Server Configuration

### üõ†Ô∏è Premium Plugins

## Our Philosophy

We believe in the perfect balance between **power** and **simplicity**.

Our mission is to offer products with advanced and premium functionalities, but without the complexity that often accompanies them. Every tool we create is designed to be intuitive to configure, robust in operation, and optimized for performance.

## Our Pillars

Everything we do is based on these four fundamental principles:

### ‚ö° Performance First
TPS is sacred. We obsessively optimize our code to ensure our products have minimal impact on performance, regardless of server size.

### üéØ Ease of Use
From clear configuration files to complete documentation, we strive to make the experience as simple and pleasant as possible.

### üí¨ Active Support
We don't just sell products, we build a community. We offer active support through Discord to help you with any questions or issues.

### üöÄ Constant Innovation
We listen to the community to continuously improve, add new features, and stay updated with the latest technologies.
