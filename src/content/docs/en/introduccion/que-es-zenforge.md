---

**Zenforge Studio** is a passionate team of developers, builders, designers, and creatives dedicated to crafting high-quality products for the Minecraft and web development community.  
We were born from the belief that the tools we create should not only be powerful but also elegant, intuitive, and optimized.

## Our Services

Zenforge Studio offers a wide range of professional services:

### 🔌 Plugin Development
We create custom plugins for Minecraft (Spigot, Paper, Purpur) tailored to your specific needs — from simple systems to complex gameplay mechanics.

### ⚙️ Server Configuration
Professional Minecraft server setup, performance optimization, plugin installation, and advanced tuning to maximize TPS.

### 🌍 Translations
Professional translation services for plugins, websites, and documentation in multiple languages (Spanish, English, Portuguese, and more).

### 🎨 Web Design & Development
Modern websites, documentation wikis, landing pages, and custom web systems built with current technologies (Astro, React, Tailwind CSS).

### 🛠️ Premium Plugins
Development and maintenance of premium plugins available on BuiltByBit, with active support and constant updates.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in the perfect balance between **power** and **simplicity**.

Our mission is to deliver products with advanced, premium features—without the unnecessary complexity that often comes with them.  
Every tool we create is designed to be intuitive to configure, robust in performance, and optimized for efficiency.

## Our Core Pillars

Everything we do is built upon these four fundamental principles:

### ⚡ Performance First
TPS is sacred. We obsessively optimize our code to ensure minimal performance impact, no matter the server size.

### 🎯 Ease of Use
From clear configuration files to complete documentation, we strive to make the experience as simple and enjoyable as possible.

### 💬 Active Support
We don’t just sell products — we build a community.  
We offer active support through Discord to help you with any questions or issues.

### 🚀 Constant Innovation
We listen to the community to continuously improve, add new features, and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.
