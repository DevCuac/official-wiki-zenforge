## Core Plugin Concepts

ZenFairy is based on two main systems that work together to encourage exploration.

### Soul Types

The heart of the plugin. You can create `fairy.yml`, `dragon.yml`, `abyssal.yml`, etc. Each file represents a unique category of collectible souls, each with its own reward menu, sounds, animations, and actions.

### Exchange Menu (`/souls menu <type>`)

An interactive and customizable menu for each soul type. Here, players can “spend” the souls they’ve found to obtain rewards. Items are smart and change appearance depending on whether the player can afford the exchange or not.

## Generated File Structure

Upon first launch, ZenFairy will create the following folder and file structure.

<FileTree>  

* ZenFairy/

  * souls/

    * **_example.yml** Template for creating new soul types.
    * **fairy.yml** Default soul type.
  * **config.yml** Main configuration (messages and location menu).
  * player_data.yml Player data storage.

</FileTree>  

## Featured Placeholders

Thanks to PlaceholderAPI integration, you can display dynamic player information.

| Placeholder                        | Description                                                       | Tags           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| `%zenfairy_souls_total_fairy%`     | Shows the total number of “fairy” souls that exist on the server. | PAPI, Info     |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin work on my Minecraft version?

ZenFairy is specifically designed for **Minecraft 1.21 and above**. It is not compatible with older versions as it uses the latest, most efficient Paper APIs.

### Does it affect server performance (TPS)?

No. ZenFairy is highly optimized. Soul animations use “marker” ArmorStands that have minimal impact on performance, and all other operations are designed to be as lightweight as possible.

### Can I customize the rewards?

Absolutely! You have full control. Each soul type has its own configuration file where you can define the menu and actions for each reward, including executing commands, granting AuraSkills stats, and more.

### Does it support multiple languages?

Yes. All player-visible messages can be customized in `config.yml`, allowing you to translate the plugin into any language.
