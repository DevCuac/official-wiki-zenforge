description: "Learn how to define collectible soul types, each with its own menus, rewards, actions, and visual effects."
---

The `souls/` folder is the heart of ZenFairy and controls all the **logic behind your collectibles**.  
Each `.yml` file you create here defines a new soul type ‚Äî its rewards, its menu, and how it interacts with the world.

This system allows you to create unique collection experiences for different zones, events, or player ranks on your server.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Structure

Each soul type is defined by a **unique ID**, which is simply the **name of the file** you create in the `/plugins/ZenFairy/souls/` folder.

> üß© **Example IDs:**
> - `fairy.yml` ‚Üí ID: `fairy`
> - `dragon.yml` ‚Üí ID: `dragon`
> - `abyssal_soul.yml` ‚Üí ID: `abyssal_soul`

---

## üìò Sections of a Soul File

Each soul `.yml` file contains multiple sections for full customization.

| Section | Required | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `display-name` | ‚úÖ | The soul‚Äôs display name shown in messages (supports color codes). |
| Sounds | ‚ùå | Defines sounds for events such as `soul-found-sound`, `soul-already-found-sound`, etc. |
| Effects | ‚ùå | Configures particles (`found-soul-particle`) and a floating head animation (`found-soul-animation`). |
| Event Actions | ‚ùå | Lists of actions (commands, messages, etc.) for events like `soul-found-actions`, `first-soul-found-actions`, and `all-souls-found-actions`. |
| `menu` | ‚úÖ | The full configuration for the soul exchange menu of this specific type. |
| `locations` | ‚öôÔ∏è | Stores the coordinates of all souls of this type. **Managed automatically by commands.** |

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Start by copying `_example.yml`, renaming it, and editing it to create your first custom soul type.

## üßæ Full Example: `dragon.yml`

Below is an example of a "dragon" soul type, showing how all sections work together to create a complete experience:

```yaml
# üêâ Definition of the "Dragon" Soul Type

# Visible name of the soul
display-name: "&cDragon Soul"

# Sound when a soul is found for the first time
soul-found-sound:
  enabled: true
  sound: ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL
  volume: 0.5
  pitch: 1.2

# Floating head animation when found
found-soul-animation:
  enabled: true
  texture: "eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvM2Y1ZDIxM2MyZWM5MGZiM2MyNWE0YmRiY2I0M2MyYjgyYmMyNTg0ZGYzY2ZmYTRkNjRiZGUzZjc2N2E0ZDYzZCJ9fX0="
  duration: 60

# Actions executed when ANY dragon soul is found
soul-found-actions:
  - "[ACTIONBAR] &c+1 Dragon Soul"

# Reward menu for this soul type
menu:
  title: "&8Dragon Rewards"
  rows: 3
  filler:
    material: RED_STAINED_GLASS_PANE
    name: " "
  items:
    dragon_strength:
      display-name: "&cWill of the Dragon"
      material: DRAGON_HEAD
      slot: 13
      souls-required: 10 # Cost in dragon souls
      available-lore:
        - "&7Trade &c10 Dragon Souls &7to"
        - "&7gain &c+2 Strength &7permanently."
        - ""
        - "&eClick to claim!"
      unavailable-lore:
        - "&7You need &c{souls_required} Dragon Souls&7."
        - "&7You are missing &c{missing_souls}&7."
      actions:
        - "[AURA-STAT] strength 2"
        - "[MESSAGE] %prefix% &cYou‚Äôve absorbed the power of the dragon! (+2 Strength)"
        - "[SOUND] ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_DEATH"

## üîç Important Notes

* **Each `.yml` file inside `/souls` is a new collectible.**
  This is the core feature of the plugin.
* **Do not manually edit the `locations` section.**
  Always use `/zf set <type>` and `/zf remove` to add or remove souls.
* **The `souls-required` value in the menu is per item.**
  You can have multiple rewards with different costs in the same menu.
* Combine ZenFairy with other plugins through actions (`[CONSOLE]`, `[PLAYER]`) to create a truly integrated reward system for your server.
