**ZenFairy** lets you run **special actions** in response to different events, such as finding a soul or clicking a menu item.  
This is the feature that makes the plugin truly powerful and customizable.

Actions are always defined inside a list called `actions:`.

## üß© Usage Examples

Below are practical examples of how and where to apply these actions.

### **In Soul Events (`fairy.yml`)**

You can trigger things automatically when a player finds a soul.

```yaml
# Executes EVERY TIME a player finds a (new) soul.
soul-found-actions:
  - "[MESSAGE] %prefix% &6You found a Fairy Soul!"
  - "[CONSOLE] eco give %player% 100"
  - "[SOUND] ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP"

# Executes only when the LAST soul of this type is found.
all-souls-found-actions:
  - "[BROADCAST] &b&l%player% has found all the Fairy Souls!"
  - "[TITLE] &dCollection Complete!;&fCongratulations!"
````

### **In a Menu Item (`fairy.yml`)**

Use actions to create interactive rewards in your trade menus.

```yaml
# Inside the menu -> items section:
items:
  # üî¥ Button to close the menu
  close_button:
    slot: 49
    material: BARRIER
    display-name: "&c&lClose"
    lore:
      - "&7Click to exit."
    actions:
      - "[CLOSE]"
      - "[SOUND] BLOCK_CHEST_CLOSE"

  # ‚ù§Ô∏è AuraSkills reward that gives extra health
  health_upgrade:
    slot: 22
    material: APPLE
    display-name: "&aExchange for Health"
    souls-required: 10
    actions:
      - "[AURA-STAT] health 1"
      - "[MESSAGE] %prefix% &aYou exchanged 10 souls for extra health."
```

## üí° Additional Notes

* You can use the placeholders `%player%` (player name) and `%prefix%` (plugin prefix from `config.yml`).
* The `[PLAYER]` action respects the player‚Äôs permissions, while `[CONSOLE]` runs with admin privileges.
* There is **no limit** ‚Äî combine as many actions as you want to create complex reward sequences.
