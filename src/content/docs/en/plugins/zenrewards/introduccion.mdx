## Core Concepts

ZenRewards is built around two main systems that work together to improve player retention.

### Rewards Menu (`/rewards`)

The heart of the plugin. A fully customizable menu where players can claim daily, weekly, unique, or rank-based rewards. Items are dynamic and change appearance based on their state (available, on cooldown, etc.).

### Streak System (`/streak`)

The crown jewel. Rewards players for logging in consecutively. This system is key to creating login habits and fostering a loyal community.

## Generated File Structure

When launched for the first time, ZenRewards creates the following folder and file structure.

<FileTree>

- ZenRewards/
  - playerdata/
    - player-uuid.yml
  - **config.yml** Main configuration
  - menu.yml Rewards menu configuration
  - rewards.yml Definition of all rewards
  - streak-menu.yml Streak menu configuration
  - streaks.yml Streak system configuration

</FileTree>

## Highlighted Placeholders

Thanks to PlaceholderAPI integration, you can display dynamic information anywhere on your server.

| Placeholder | Description | Tags |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| `%zenrewards_streak_current%` | Shows the player’s current login streak in days. | PAPI, Streak |
| `%zenrewards_cooldown_daily_reward%` | Shows the remaining cooldown for the reward with ID 'daily_reward'. Displays "Ready" when available. | PAPI, Cooldown |
| `%zenrewards_total_claimed%` | Total number of rewards claimed by the player. | PAPI, Statistics |

:::note[Customizable Placeholder]
You can replace the `daily_reward` ID with the ID of any configured reward in `rewards.yml`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin work with my Minecraft version?

Yes! ZenRewards is built for backwards compatibility. It works from **1.8.8 up to 1.21.x** and beyond.  
We use the XSeries library to automatically handle material and sound differences between versions.

### Does it affect server performance (TPS)?

No. Core operations such as menu updates and data handling are optimized.  
The real-time cooldown update system only activates for players who have the menu open, preventing unnecessary load.

### Can I customize the rewards?

Absolutely. All rewards, cooldowns, messages, and appearances are defined in easy-to-edit YAML files.  
Check out the [Configuration](03-config) section for more details.

### Does it support multiple languages?

Yes. All messages are configurable in `config.yml`, and you can translate them to any language you prefer.  
It also supports color and formatting using standard Minecraft codes.
